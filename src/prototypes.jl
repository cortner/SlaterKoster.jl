"""
`struct SparseSKH` :
a triplet sparse matrix kind of thing that stores pre-computed
hamiltonian blocks, and can efficiently generate k-dependent Hamiltonians,
either sparse of full.

### Methods:
* `full(A::SparseSKH, k)`: returns full `H`, `M` for given `k`-vector.
* `full!(out, A, k)`: same as `full`, but in-place

### Methods to be implemented:
* `sparse(A::SparseSKH, k)`: same but sparse
* `collect(A::SparseSKH, k)`: chooses full (small systems) or sparse (large
                           systems) based on some simple heuristic

### Fields:
* `H` : the hamiltonian used to construct it
* `at` : the associated atoms object
* `i, j` : row and column indices
* `first` : `first[n]` is the index in `i, j` for which `i[idx] == n`
* `vH` : Hamiltonian blocks
* `vM` : overlap blocks
* `Rcell` : each hamiltonian block is associated with an e^{i k â‹… S} multiplier
            from the Bloch transform; this S is stored in Rcell.
